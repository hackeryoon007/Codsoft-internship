 Flow of the App (Left to Right)
1. Login & Authentication Screens
First two frames (leftmost) show a welcome/login screen:

One with a profile avatar, email/username field, and password input.

Both use a glassmorphism effect with blurred backgrounds, enhancing modern appeal.

Buttons are minimal and accessible with rounded corners and soft shadows.

2. Main App Flow Begins
Home Screen:

Displays account balance and quick action buttons (likely for transfer, deposit, etc.).

Tab bar at the bottom includes icons for navigation.

GPT Screen:

Probably a chatbot or AI assistant integration.

A subtle background with a prompt input in center.

Investment Planning Screen:

Shows multiple financial instruments with icons (stocks, crypto, mutual funds).

Each card is cleanly color-coded for distinction.

Financial Data Representation Screen:

Rich with data charts, bar graphs, and line plots.

Likely for real-time tracking of assets, gains, or spending trends.

3. Right Cluster â€“ Utility and Expansion Screens
These are shown in a vertical stack on the right:

Notepad Screen:

A small, tidy section for writing down thoughts or personal finance notes.

Goals Screen (Completed + In Progress):

Task-style layout with progress bars and categories.

Organized to separate future goals from those already achieved.

Bank Integration Screens:

Multiple cards showing different linked bank accounts.

Each card shows account number, bank logo, and balance.

Notification Screen:

Neatly structured notification cards.

Icons suggest categories like reminders, warnings, or updates.

Profile Screen:

Includes user avatar, settings list (account, security, preferences).

Cleanly laid out with intuitive navigation.

ðŸ”§ How It Works â€“ User Journey Logic
Letâ€™s walk through a typical use case of the app, based on your design:

User logs in through the elegant login screen.

Redirected to Home Screen, which gives a dashboard of current finances.

User can then:

Consult the GPT Assistant for suggestions.

Go to Investment Planning to explore and plan assets.

View deep Financial Graphs and insights.

Set and monitor Goals â€” both current and completed.

Check Notifications about account activities.

Manage settings through the Profile Page.

Use the Notepad to jot down ideas or reminders.

Seamlessly view details of all linked bank accounts.

The navbar component at the bottom ensures smooth navigation, with uniform icons across all screens. Every screen maintains consistency in theme, color palette, and typography (likely Montserrat or similar).
